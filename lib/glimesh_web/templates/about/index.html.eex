            <%= gettext("Glimesh came out of the shutdown of Mixer. When Microsoft pulled the plug on the platform overnight, communities were left without a home, streamers were left without a paycheck, and technologists were left without a viable alternative to the \"FTL\" product Mixer offered. To us, this event was painful to watch, and we decided then that streamers deserve better. We started working on an early alpha preview immediately to prove the technology and the business we wanted to build. We hosted a charity stream within a month that raised over $3,000 powered by our platform. Since then, we've been hard at work building the remaining features & scaling requirements for an alpha launch, and that brings us to today!") %>
