If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will notify you through either the Site user interface, an email notification, or other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.

          General
        </h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Glimesh and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and Glimesh with respect to the Site. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Glimesh agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The failure of Glimesh to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Glimesh, but Glimesh may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Site may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Site. In the event of a conflict of a translated version of these Terms of Service and the English language version of these Terms of Service, the English Version of these Terms will be the control document.
